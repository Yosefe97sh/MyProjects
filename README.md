# MyProjects
these are some of the projects that I worked on during my university time.


1- AI-Based Sign Language Translator: it works by uploading a picture of a hand sign then it will show the prediction, you can find some hand poses at the same file of the project, it also contains a file called project details which contains the report for the project to get more details about model development and testing, also another file called poster.

2- Library Database: it contains a pdf file that shows the project in detail and another file that is the whole schema of the database

3- Live Chat: it is a Java file that contains methods for the sender and receiver, also it checks if the message is received or not by calculating the checksum in the receiver side and checking the acknowledgment from the server side.

4- Pet Care website: it is a website that has been programmed using Java, HTML, JS, and Java database, we used Component-Based programming to make the project easier to scale and fix. 

5- Logo Animation: we chose the Zoom logo to do some animation on it, we have made 3 different animations on it using Java and OpenGL.

6- Web Design: it is a project where we have to search for a website with bad UI/UX and make another version of it where it could have better UI/UX, the file contains a report that has all details needed about the website before and after the changes, you can find the Figma project URL at the end of the PDF file.

7- SDA-Machine Learning: The idea of this project is that i have soldiers dataset and i want to predict thier race based on thier phisycal features, This project focuses on predictive modeling using machine learning techniques to address imbalanced datasets. The project includes data preprocessing, resampling methods (SMOTE and random undersampling), and training a logistic regression model, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and compare them and try to achieve a balanced classification outcome.

8- This project focuses on customer segmentation based on purchasing history data from a large mall's membership cards. It involves Exploratory Data Analysis to understand data distribution and relationships, variable selection for cluster analysis, and the application of K-Means Clustering to group customers into distinct clusters, each assigned a descriptive label. This project is a practical exercise that provides valuable insights for businesses aiming to tailor their marketing and services to distinct customer segments, making it an ideal choice for those with a foundation in Python and an interest in cluster analysis and machine learning.

9- In this project, I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset comprises 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items categorized into ten different classes. I loaded and preprocessed the data, including normalizing the pixel values and converting labels to one-hot encoding. I constructed a CNN model with various layers, including convolutional, pooling, and dense layers, and compiled it with categorical cross-entropy loss and the RMSprop optimizer. I trained the model with early stopping and evaluated its performance using a classification report, which included accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. I also examined the class distribution and potential class imbalances in the dataset. The project provided valuable insights into building and assessing image classification models for fashion items.
